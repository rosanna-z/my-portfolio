      Hi there!
      My name is Rosanna Zhang. I am a full-stack developer with an interest in front-end development. 
      I have a Bachelor of Management from University of British Columbia and more recently, 
      I completed the Lighthouse Lab's Web Development Bootcamp program. 

      As someone transitioning from Human Resources, I hope to utilize my people and technical skills to create efficient and effective solutions. 
      I am committed to tackling goals to solve real-world issues to make a positive impact in the community.

      Here are the technologies I've been working on lately:
      <p>
        - Javascript
        - React.js
        - Node.js
        - Next.js
      </p>
    </div>
    </>
  )
